## Food 101 challenge - for Fellowship.AI challenge

The question is stated as follows:

"Food-101 is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it.  Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5.  These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and  even novel architectures.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.  "

### **Task: Classification**

Classification of 101 different classes of food, using a dataset containing 1000 labeled images per class available for supervised training.


### **Goal : Attain >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set.**

Top-1 accuracy is the accuracy as commonly understood. For our model, it is decided by the class with the highest probability determined by the network.


### **Constraints**

- using a ResNet50 or smaller network 
- with a reasonable set of augmentations.

## **My thoughts** 
My immediate considerations were:
- Using Transfer learning
- Use traditional data augmentation techniques
- Use Resnet50 or a smaller network in terms of number of parameters (ieï¼šmobilenet ?)
- Pay attention to colab runtime limitations

Please see the attached Colab notebook. The code can be run directly from Colab ( It will download the dataset and start the training using the relevant code sections )
Or you can just read it :)

Suggestions are welcome.
